# Percent Tool

Simple tool to find the percentage difference between two numbers. This one always confused me for a while so I built this to help people figure it out.

## Usage

Just input two numbers and the app automatically calculates the percentage difference from the first number to the second number.

Weird thing: If you increase 10 by 50%, it becomes 15, and if you decrease 15 by 50%, it becomes 7.5 -- tricky. 

### How to run it on your own machine

1. Install the requirements

   ```
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the app

   ```
   $ streamlit run streamlit_app.py
   ```
